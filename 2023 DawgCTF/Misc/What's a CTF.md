## What's a CTF? (25 Points)


### Problem
```
In a jeopardy-style CTF (Capture the Flag) competition, 
teams compete to solve challenges covering a variety of cybersecurity categories and topics. 
For each challenge, your goal is to find a "flag",
which often looks like a DawgCTF{str1ng_separ4ted_by_und3rscores_like_this}
(this is also the flag for this challenge). 
There are exceptions.

You may have to find this flag by analyzing provided materials 
(a log file, an encrypted message)
or breaking into a vulnerable application (an simulated online banking app).
You're expected to research and use the internet during the competition to
figure out how to solve the challenges.
```

### Solution
Copy and paste the flag given in the problem into the submission field

Flag = `DawgCTF{str1ng_separ4ted_by_und3rscores_like_this}`
