## Hac-Man (250 Points)


### Problem
```
Sometimes, it's okay to unfairly conquer a game or two!
```

### Solution
We are given the file PacManForCTF.jar

To start off any java-based challenge, I like to decompile it with [Java Decompiler](http://java-decompiler.github.io/)

This can give important insight into how the program works or even just show the flag

`private final String flag = "THIS IS NOT HOW YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THE CHALLENGE. YOU CAN IF YOU WANT BUT IT'LL BE EASIER TO JUST CHEAT :) IF YOU DO REVERSE THIS, PLEASE DO A WRITE UP! I'M VERY CURIOUS TO HEAR THE PROCESS";`

OK



There is some useful information
```
public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    if (this.score >= 6942069) {
      this.winner = true;
      this.score = 6942069;
    } else {
      int mazeX = (this.pacX + this.pacVelocityX) / 24;
      int mazeY = (this.pacY + this.pacVelocityY) / 24;
      if (mazeX > 0 && mazeX < 80 && mazeY > 0 && mazeY < 80 && this.maze[mazeX][mazeY] != 0) {
        this.pacX += this.pacVelocityX;
        this.pacY += this.pacVelocityY;
        if (this.maze[mazeX][mazeY] == 1) {
          this.maze[mazeX][mazeY] = 2;
          this.score += 10;
          if (this.score == 64000)
            this.loser = true; 
        } 
      } 
    } 
    repaint();
  }
```

We did learn some important things:
+ The intended solution is cheating
+ The way to win is by having a score greater than 6942069
+ You cannot win without cheating since you lose if your score is 64000

I turned to [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/downloads.php) for RAM viewing and manipulation

After loading the game into Cheat Engine I did a memory scan looking for the value of my current score (10)

I then got a few more points so that I could look for the memory address that stored the points value

Once I found the memory value I changed the stored value to 6942069 and got the flag


Flag = `DawgCTF{ch3at3R_ch34t3r_pumk1n_34t3r!}`



## Bonus

I spent several hours trying to reverse engineer the .jar file, but couldn't get any results

I tried:
+ decompiling the file to look for the flag
+ changing values with a class file editor
+ changing the boolean statement to check if you won

No matter what I did the the game would not recompile
