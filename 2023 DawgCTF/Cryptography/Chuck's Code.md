## Challenge Title (125 Points)


### Problem
```
I got this from some guy who said a guy called Chuck gave it to him.
He wouldn't elaborate, but he said if I could figure out what it meant, I could have his autographed martial arts black belt!

### Solution
I have never seen this cipher before so I immediatly go to the [Cipher Identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) on Dcode.fr

The first result back is the [Chuck Norris Unary Code](https://www.dcode.fr/chuck-norris-code)

Based on the title of the challenge and problem statement, I think this one is pretty clearly correct

All that's left is to decrypt the message and get the flag


Flag = `DawgCTF{chuck_n0rr1s_p0w3rs!}`
