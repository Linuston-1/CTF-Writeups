## Celestial Caper (50 Points)


### Problem
```
Isn't the lunar surface cool?
Surely, though, there's more than what meets the eye!
The solution will be case insensitive, and contain only characters a-z.
The flag format will be DawgCTF{solutioninlowercase}
```

### Solution
We are given a sequence of pictures fo the moon at different phases

I have never seen this cipher before so I Google `moon cipher`

Since this is a cryptography challenge [Dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/en) is bound to show up

Google comes back with [Dcode's Lunar Alphabet decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/lunar-alphabet-leandro-katz) and it is a perfect match

From here is is just a matter of matching the given pictures with the ones one Dcode

Flag = `DawgCTF{MOONMAN}`
