## Linear Algebra Homework (100 Points)


### Problem
```
You are chilling in your room, listening to music when your sibling barges in

Sibling: “I need help with my linear algebra homework”
*shows the crushed up paper*
You: “where are the instructions?”
Your sibling just shrugs, “i dunno”
You sigh and get to work deciphering the letters underneath the matrix.

### Solution
The first thing that I searched up when doing this problem was `matrix cipher`

This brought me to [Wikipedia's Hill Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_cipher) article

It has a picture of the exact same matrix as the challenge

Since I did not feel like doing any actual liner algebra, I went back to Dcode.fr
It had a [hill cipher decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/hill-cipher)

All that was left was to input the matrix and ciphertext
