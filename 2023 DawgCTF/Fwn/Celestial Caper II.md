## Celestial Caper II (200 Points)


### Problem
```
My dad is big into astronomy and said he'd give me a hundred bucks if I could figure out what astronomical object this is!
Can you help?

### Solution
This challenge can be done fairly simply with a reverse image search

Upon completing the search, the image is found to be of the Dolphin Head Nebula

However, the flag is not the name of the celestial object, but its Sharpless 2 number

Luckily, the SH2 number is also listed on the images from the reverse image search

Flag = `SH2-308`
